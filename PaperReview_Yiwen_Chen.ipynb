    "## Brief Summary\n",
    "The tool \"sparql-gremlin\" is created to translate SPARQL queries to Gremilin pattern matching travesals. The sparql-gremlin allow users to run queries expressed in the W3C SPARQL query language over wide variety of graph data management system (OLTP and OLAP). As of the time of the paper, sparql-gremlin is only a plugin of the apache ThinkerPop graph computing framework."

    "## What was the Problem?\n",
    "**Main Problem : SPARQL and Gremlin lack interoperability**\n",
    "- Knowledge graphs have become increasingly popular\n",
    "- Property Graphs (PG) vs W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF)\n",
    "- RDF is suited for distributed\n",
    "data integration with built-in world-wide unique identifiers\n",
    "and vocabularies\n",
    "- PGs on the other hand support horizontally\n",
    "scalable storage and querying, and are widely used for modern\n",
    "data analytics applications.\n",
    "- Standard query language for RDF databases is SPARQL, whereas PG databases is Gremline traversal language\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Solution\n",
    "**Solution : Creating a that allows the execution of SPARQL queries over graph databases by translating them to Gremilin travesals (sparql-gremlin)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation & Goal \n",
    "**Motivation: It will help users creating knowledge graph more easier and it one of the first formally published work that address the query interoperability issue between SPARQL and PG query laguage**\n",
